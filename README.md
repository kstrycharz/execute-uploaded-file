# execute-uploaded-file


# Vulerable web application that prompts a user to upload a file. 
This app simulates a phishing attack where a user opens a malicious file
Once downloaded, a command of one's choice will be executed. My use case is for students in a penetration testing course, where a libreoffice document is uploaded and executed, including its macros.
